# Sea-wind-speed-and-direction-estimation-using-SAR

This research used neural network (NN) and random forests (RF) models to estimate sea wind speed and direction using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. We used RADARSAT (RS)-2 C-band single look complex (SLC) fine quad-polarimetric data and buoy measurements. After data preparation, SAR data are paired with their relevant buoy observation. Then, SAR data parameters expected to be impacted by sea wind are generated. While the spatial resolution of our RS-2 data is 4.7× 5.1m 2, we cropped each image to a chip of 512× 512 pixels centered by its related buoy and averaged the parameters over the image chip. Therefore, this study’s estimated wind speed and direction resolution is approximately 2.45× 2.65km 2. Then, parameters are separated to train and test data by repeated k-fold cross-validation (CV). Also, successive halving random search CV is used to tune NN and RF hyperparameters.
